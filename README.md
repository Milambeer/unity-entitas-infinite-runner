# Technology overview
Unity is a great game engine, but making games with it can be really painfull when the project grow in size and/or other people join it. The base code become harder to maintain and improve.

That why i choose to learn Entitas which is an Entity-Composent-System framework that organize the project in a more readable way and use the power of Entity/Composition pattern to build it.
