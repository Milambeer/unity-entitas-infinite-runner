This project aims to show integration of entitas within a small unity project.

* Pause menu
* End game menu to relaunch the game

```

* Open the root folder as a unity project

* Launch the Game scene

* Run !

# Technology overview
Unity is a great game engine, but making games with it can be really painful when the project grows in size and/or other people join it. The base code becomes harder to maintain and improve.

That is why I choose to learn Entitas which is an Entity-Composent-System framework that organizes the project in a more readable way and uses the power of Entity/Composition pattern to build it.
